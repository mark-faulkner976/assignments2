## MERN Stack User Authentication Workshop

### Technologies and Libraries

We'll be leveraging the following technologies and libraries to implement user authentication:

1. **bcrypt**: A library for securely hashing passwords. It employs a one-way hashing algorithm, making it computationally expensive to reverse the process and obtain the original password.
   
2. **dotenv**: A module used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This allows us to store sensitive information such as database credentials and secret keys securely.

3. **express-jwt**: Middleware for Express.js that provides JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for routes. It verifies the token sent by the client and extracts its payload to authenticate HTTP requests.

4. **jsonwebtoken**: A library used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are encoded tokens containing information about the user and are used for user authentication.

### Concepts Explored

Throughout this tutorial, we'll delve into the following key concepts:

1. **Token-based Authentication**: Understanding the concept of token-based authentication and its advantages over traditional session-based authentication.
   
2. **Hashing and Salting**: Exploring the process of securely hashing passwords using bcrypt. We'll discuss the importance of salting to add an extra layer of security to hashed passwords.

3. **JWT Structure and Usage**: Understanding the structure of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how they are generated and verified. We'll explore how JWTs can securely transmit user information between the client and server.

4. **Middleware Integration**: Integrating middleware such as express-jwt into our Express.js application to authenticate HTTP requests. We'll learn how to protect routes and endpoints using JWT authentication.

5. **User Authentication Flow**: Examining the step-by-step flow of user authentication, from registration to login and subsequent access to protected resources.
